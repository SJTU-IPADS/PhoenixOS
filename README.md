    <b>PhoenixOS</b> (PhOS) is an OS-level GPU checkpoint/restore (C/R) system. It can <b>transparently</b> C/R processes that use the GPU, without requiring any cooperation from the application (though with cooperation it would be faster :)).
    Most importantly, PhOS is the first (and only) OS-level GPU C/R system that can <b>concurrently execute C/R without stopping the execution of applications</b>.
    <p>
    Concurrent execution brings huge performance gains, e.g., please check below when compared with NVIDIA's CUDA-Checkpoint <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-checkpoint">nvidia/cuda-checkpoint</a>:

    </table>
    <p>
    Note that PhOS is aiming to be a generic design towards various hardware platforms from different vendors, by providing a set of interfaces which should be implemented by specific hardware platforms. We currently provide the C/R implementation on CUDA platform, and we are planning to support ROCm and Ascend. Yet we hope we could get help from the community because getting the whole C/R done is really non-trivial.

## I. Quick build 

Currently, we don't have pre-built binaries. 
Please check [build from Source](docs/docs/getting_started/build_from_source.md) for how to build and run from source! 

## II. Usage

Once successfully installed PhOS, you can now try run your program with PhOS support!

<table style="margin:20px 0px;">
    <tr><td><b>
    For more details, you can refer to <a href="https://github.com/SJTU-IPADS/PhoenixOS/tree/main/examples"><code>examples</code></a> for step-by-step tutorials to run PhOS.
    </b></td></tr>

### (1) Start `phosd` and your program

1. Start the PhOS daemon (`phosd`), which takes over all GPU reousces on the node:

    ```bash
    ## If built in an interactive container (or host)
    pos_cli --start --target daemon
    ```

    or 

    ```bash
    ## If built with our container
    make server-run
    ```

2. To run your program with PhOS support, one need to put a `yaml` configure file under the directory which your program would regard as `$PWD`.
This file contains all necessary informations for PhOS to hijack your program. An example file looks like:

    ```yaml
    # [Field]   name of the job
    # [Note]    job with same name would share some resources in posd, e.g., CUModule, etc.
    job_name: "llama2-13b-chat-hf"

    # [Field]   remote address of posd, default is local
    daemon_addr: "127.0.0.1"
    ```

3. You are going for launch now! Try run your program with `env $phos` prefix, for example:

    ```bash
    env $phos python3 train.py
    ```

### (2) Pre-dump your program

To pre-dump your program, which save the CPU & GPU state without stopping your execution, simple run:

```bash
# create directory to store checkpoing files
mkdir /root/ckpt

# pre-dump command
pos_cli --pre-dump --dir /root/ckpt --pid [your program's pid]
```

### (3) Dump your program

To dump your program, which save the CPU & GPU state and stop your execution, simple run:

```bash
# create directory to store checkpoing files
mkdir /root/ckpt

# pre-dump command
pos_cli --dump --dir /root/ckpt --pid [your program's pid]
```


### (4) Restore your program

To restore your program, simply run:

```bash
# restore command
pos_cli --restore --dir /root/ckpt
```
